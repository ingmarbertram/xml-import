## Retrieving the feed
The file containing the information to be imported (from now on: the _feed_) can be either static or dynamically generated on request. Please make sure that the content is delivered within a reasonable amount of time from the request.

Our system supports the retrieval of the feed via HTTP, HTTPS and FTP.
Basic authentication methods are also supported out-of-the-box. [Here you can find more information about the supported authentication methods](../shared/authentication.md).
